Have you wanted to ever just download a ImGui DirectX hook off github and have
clean readable code ready to use and a clean & simple GUI? You've come to the right
place, in this repo. I have created an entire D3D11 Hook 
(credits to https://github.com/rdbo/ImGui-DirectX-11-Kiero-Hook) 
for the orignal D3D11 hook code. Thanks for reading, and enjoy.
